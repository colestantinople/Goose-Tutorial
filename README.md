# Goose-Tutorial

Goose is a super basic tool for creating web components on a website.

By allowing the developer to define their own HTML/CSS/JS components in a single place, Goose encourages 
adherence to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle without any JavaScript knowledge required.

This repository demonstrates the functionality of Goose.

## How to download Goose and begin using it.

Simply clone [Goose](https://github.com/colestantinople/Goose) into the root of your web project and follow the instructions in its `readme.md` file.
